  "data": "Ethan Sherwood Strauss joins me today to discuss the way we view certain Western Conference teams. The Golden State Warriors are being hyped up quite a bit with magazine covers and preseason expectations. Is it justified? What is the deal with Harrison Barnes\u0027 foot inflammation? Should Warriors fans be worried about reserves Toney Douglas and Marreese Speights replacing Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry?We also look into the discussion going on with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Have we been too hard on them because of the James Harden trade? Weren\u0027t they one of the best teams in the regular season last year that got derailed from title contention by injuries and not opponents? Is there hope for Steven Adams and Jeremy Lamb contributing soon? Should we be cognizant of Kevin Durant\u0027s free agency in 2016?We discuss all of that, plus engagement announcements, dogs playing defense, and players criticizing the media.You can follow Ethan Sherwood Strauss on Twitter at @SherwoodStrauss.Have questions for the podcast?
