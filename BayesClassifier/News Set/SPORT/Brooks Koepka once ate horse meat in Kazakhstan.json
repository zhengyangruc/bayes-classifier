(USATSI) More Golf: Leaderboard | Rankings | Schedule | Expert Picks | Equipment | FedEx CupBrooks Koepka is not a name you\u0027ve likely heard of yet.The 23-year-old hasn\u0027t been playing much of the PGA Tour recently (he\u0027s been playing Europe instead) but he nearly won last week at the Frys.com Open and he\u0027s going to be a star on US soil someday.And when he becomes a star, one story from his trips around the world is going to permeate your television. The former Florida State Seminole, and roommate of Peter Uihlein, once ate horse meat in Kazakhstan. Steve DiMeglio of USA Today interviewed him and asked him what that experience was like.\"That I won\u0027t ever forget.\"He also talked about taking on the Challenge Tour (where he won three times) and European Tour instead of the PGA Tour.\"It\u0027s been a bit different. But traveling the world is a great experience. You learn how to handle yourself, you see other cultures and you just take everything in. Through it all, at the end of the day it\u0027s just golf, and I felt my game was good enough to expect results.\"It certainly is.For more golf news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnGolf and @KylePorterCBS on Twitter or Google+ and like us on Facebook.",
